# DESCRIPTION: The TABIND Scrabble Project aims to develop a program that takes   #
# the letter combination “tabind” and creates an alphabetical list of all the     #
# valid words that can be found with those letters. The project utilizes Python   #
# to generate permutations of the letters and filters them using a                #
# comprehensive word list.                                                        #
